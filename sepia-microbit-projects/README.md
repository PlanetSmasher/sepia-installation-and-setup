# SEPIA micro:bit Code and Tools

## Microbit Bluetooth LE Beacon Remote

The BLE remote is a program for the BBC micro:bit to broadcast Eddystone Beacon data on the push of a (or two) buttons.
This can be used to remotely control a SEPIA client using certain Eddystone URLs to carry the control info.
