# Nginx Settings and Tools

## Configuration Files

This folder contains configuration files to use Nginx as reverse proxy and web-server for SEPIA.

## How to

### Linux

* Run the Nginx setup script located in your SEPIA base folder (~/SEPIA) via `bash setup-nginx.sh`.

You can choose between a simple configuration without SSL or use the advanced setup with public certificates generated by Let's Encrypt.
See the wiki page for details: https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-docs/wiki/SSL-for-your-Server  
  
If you want to edit the files inside the 'sites-available' folder manually you can do that as well. Copy them over to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` (default Nginx folder) when you're done.

### Windows

* Install Nginx
* Choose one of the config files from the (SEPIA\nginx\) 'sites-available' folder and modify it as required (adjust the variables inside the SSL version, e.g. [my-...])
* Copy it over to your Nginx installation, there should be a folder called 'sites-enabled'.
